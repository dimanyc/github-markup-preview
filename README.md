# Hello. This is the GitHub Markup Preview.

I know you've been missing it - simple tool that allows you to edit and instantly preview your README files before committing them.

Take a look at the demo [here](http://dfilimonov.com/github-markup-preview).

This preview on the right side looks exactly the same as it would look like on GitHub.

Refresh the page. Your markup stays here until you close the browser tab. Isn't that great?

Supported formats are:
* github flavored markup - **fully supported**
* simple markdown
* rdoc
* textile
* wiki
* org
* creole
